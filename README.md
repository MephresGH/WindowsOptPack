# Windows Optimization Pack
## A pack that sets the goal to be as transparent, automatic and stable as possible while improving fatal flaws inside Windows 7 and upwards, utilizing multiple free tools that improve, fix and stabilize the general Windows experience.


### Introduction:
This is the public repository of the Mephres Windows Optimization Pack.
This pack has been primarily tested on Windows 10 only, but the majority of optimizations should also be compatible with Windows 7 and 11.
The pack has been tested by several people to assure this pack's reliability and make its content run successfully with each run.
The goal of this pack is to make Windows require less resources, be lighter in storage and give you more control over your privacy and system.
If you experience any bugs, want to make suggestions, or just give general feedback, you can reach me out through Twitter or my YouTube channel.


### Installation Instructions:
Enable the MSI Mode for every device that supports MSI and MSIX Mode for reduced latency.
The "Windows Preparations" folder serves as a base for people who reinstall their systems frequently and want to start quick on their feet.


### Script Instructions:
The Microsoft Edge Purge script should only be run when you already have a browser of choice. If you use Edge, you can skip this step.
After running DDU (no matter if in Safe- or Normal Mode), restart your PC and run NVCleanstall while being disconnected to the internet.
When NVCleanstall is open, re-connect to the internet and follow the image guide.
Timer Resolution and its issues already have been addressed and are in the Optimization Script, working permanently.


### Notes:
Do NOT modify any files or orders in this pack, as it can result in failure of the scripts and this pack altogether.
It is recommended to follow the steps of this pack in specified order to minimize possible mistakes.
If you should experience any weird behavior or boot time issues, re-run the System Integrity script, then the Tron script, and finish off with the rest of the pack.
Further instructions can be found in the "ReadMe" text files or example images in the "Files" folders for each representative program.
As last words of this section: this pack won't cover CPU Overclocking and BIOS tweaking (besides HPET).

### Final Notes:
This script is being worked upon constantly. Major changes to this script can be done at any time for safety- or performance reasons.
For the most optimal functionality, safety and stability, you should always run this script after every major update and keep it up-to-date.
At last: you can work on this pack for your own purposes and publish it for free under the guidelines of keeping the original README intact and updating it regularly and more, as this pack is free and open source, licensed under the GPL v2.0.
I hope this pack will help you/has helped you. Have a good day and wish you the best.
